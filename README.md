# weather_me_this 

this is the 6th or 7th version of this weather app that i haven been working on. with the help of my collegues, friends, family, instructors, and tutors i was finally able to get a working version. with css, javaScript, and bootstrap

this is just a basic weather app that will give you the current weather and the next 5 days of which city that you enter.

to use this app all you have to do is...
- into the search bar type a major city in the US that you are trying to acquire the weather of. 
- click the search button
- recieve the details


this had been made for functionality purposes.
if anyone would like to play with the css or javascript inorder to make it more engaging/interactive/pleasuarble by all means feel free to have fun. i will most likely be doing the same later.
